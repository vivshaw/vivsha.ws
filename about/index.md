I'm a developer from Burlington, Vermont. I'm an alumna of the University of Vermont, with a B.A. in Economics and Philosophy.

When I'm not coding, you'll generally find me reading weird fiction, stir-frying things, watching Cronenberg films, or noodling around with my synthesizers.

You can find me on Twitter at [@irreduce](https://twitter.com/irreduce) and on GitHub at [vivshaw](https://github.com/vivshaw).
