# vivshaw's website, version 1.

This was the original version of my website, which I put up back in Spring of 2017. It was hosted at https://vivshaw.github.io. It was built with Jekyll, using the Skinny Bones theme by the excellent [Michael Rose/mademistakes](https://mademistakes.com/). I customized it a fair bit to add details that were to my taste at the time- a botanical image with soothing dark earth tones and shallow-focus photography, an angular background cutout, a fancy landing page, and other such things. This humble page launched my career and kept me going for a long time, and I'll be thankful for that for a long time.

As I customized it, it eventually stopped being automagically buildable by GitHub Pages. This proved to be the death knell, as the extra hoops of juggling branches, building locally, and pushing the build result added enough inertia that I stopped updating regularly. (GitHub actions didn't exist back then, and I didn't know about CI/CD anyways.) Eventually, I went back and revived my site with a from-scratch build as [version 2](https://github.com/vivshaw/vivshaw.net/tree/v2).

Original README is as follows.
