# TODO

- [ ] There's an error with `'` and `"` in Prism code blocks of unknown language
- [ ] Make `code` blocks more legible
- [ ] Nicer component for loading images in MDX?
- [ ] Line numbers in code blocks
- [ ] Code block highlights
- [ ] Code block styles for CLI
- [ ] tags index page & tag pages, someday
- [ ] Get "Next Post" working for real
- [ ] Type post meta, if possible. or swap to using frontmatter! and at least document the metadata schema
- [ ] Yarn PnP support? (Not compatible with Turborepo... yet!)
- [ ] Monorepo it? (Turborepo? NX?)
- [ ] Storybook & design system
- [ ] Fix janky width changing when scrollbar shows or hides, again. now it's on smaller screens?
- [ ] more accessible focus states
- [ ] change "More articles from vivshaw's" to something that reads better
- [ ] stop using global transition variables, and standardize transitions more generally
- [ ] sans is only used in tables, should I drop it?
- [ ] heading styles in MDX get broken alignment on small screens
- [ ] fix navbar appearance & alignment in mobile menu
- [ ] colors fade from light to dark on first page load. that should be fixed. probably this requires moving to global theming so I can style `html` and `body`
- [ ] image optimization for static exports?
- [ ] update PWA library
- [ ] consistent footer spacing- `40px` maybe?
- [ ] obliterate `pageStyles` directory
- [ ] should simple components like `AboutList` and friends be components, or just CSS files?
- [ ] extract MDX components to a separate package?
- [ ] new icon. dark mode icon would be sick whilst I'm at it.
- [ ] set up Google verification, etc
- [ ] better branded theme color
- [ ] restyle so all pages can share `.centeringWrapper` etc.
- [ ] get structured schema.org metadata working again
- [ ] generate robots.txt, sitemap.xml, etc.
