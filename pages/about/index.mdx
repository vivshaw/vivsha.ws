## Howdy!ğŸ¤ 

I'm a software engineer from Burlington, Vermont. I'm an alumna of the University of Vermont, with a B.A. in Economics and Philosophy. My central interests are in functional programming, building modern, data-driven web applications, and machine learning. [Obfuscated code](https://github.com/vivshaw/three-wise-monkeys) is a side hobby of mine.

When I'm not hacking on stuff, you'll generally find me reading weird fiction, cycling, stir-frying things, watching Cronenberg films, or DJing house and techno sets.
