The delightful [Alison Cossette](https://twitter.com/alison_cossette) and I just co-presented a talk at [Burlington Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Burlington-Data-Scientists/) on using public data for business purposes. (My first talk ever!) My half of the talk was about using Python, Javascript, & GIS systems to mash up public economic & geographic datasets to build interactive visualizations of trends in employment within the IT industry. [My slides & demo apps are up here](https://vivshaw.github.io/4-19-public-data-talk/).
