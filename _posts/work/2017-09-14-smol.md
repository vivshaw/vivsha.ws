[smol](https://github.com/vivshaw/smol-v1) was my Rails learning app. As you can see, it never got too far off the ground, but what I learned laid the foundation for my further Rails epxlorations. At the moment, I'm working on OpenAuth with Devise & Omniauth, and testing with Rspec and Factory_Girl. Why, you might ask, am I exploring Rails in 2017? Let's be honest, largely because Ruby and Rails are both so delightfully developer-friendly & easy to play with. The code is, of course, all [on my GitHub](https://github.com/vivshaw/smol-v1).
