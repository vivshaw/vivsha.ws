A simple noteboard written in Scala on the Play Framework.

[Notes.scala](http://notes-scala.herokuapp.com/) was my first Scala project and an attempt to learn my way around [reactive](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) web development in the [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/). Nothing too fancy here, just a simple CRUD app, with a [Bootstrap v4-alpha](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) frontend (because I wanted to play with the new [Card component](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/)). It was super fun to build, because Play is quick to get started with (much more so than Spring at least, if not so quick as Rails) & has a solid development workflow. I've got a [live demo](http://notes-scala.herokuapp.com/) up on Heroku, and as always, the code is [on GitHub here](https://github.com/vivshaw/Notes.scala).
