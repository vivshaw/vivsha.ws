{{ page.excerpt }}

[smol](https://smol.space/) is my Rails learning app. As I've been learning more, I've been gradually building out features. Why, you might ask, am I exploring Rails in 2017? Partially because I wanted to familiarize myself more with the classic server-based CRUD app way of doing things... but, let's be honest, largely because it's so developer-friendly & easy to play with. The code is, of course, all [on my GitHub](https://github.com/vivshaw/scriptophile).
