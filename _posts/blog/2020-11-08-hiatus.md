Haven't posted in a while! I've spent the past two years doing contract work for MoonGate Technology on a college planning app called I'm In, and we've just launched a beta! [Check it out](https://iminap.com/) if you're curious what I've been up to.

In general terms, I've moved towards TypeScript for added type-safety on the frontend, and GraphQL for type-safety at the API query layer. Combine this with TypeScript/Node or Rails on the backend, and you've got something good going! I've found this stack extremely comfy and hassle-free, and enjoyed the reduction in bugs that type-safety has brought.

Got some big things in the pipeline- in particular, hoping to leave my day job and move to development work full-time. (If you're interested in hiring me, please reach out!) I'm also starting a deeper exploration of functional programming with Haskell.
