Perhaps you've run across Twitter bots like [@thesefutures](https://twitter.com/thesefutures) or [@thinkpiecebot](https://twitter.com/thinkpiecebot) and been intrigued. For the non-technically-inclined, it's easy enough to create a bot with a tool that will handle the heavy lifting for you, like [cheap bots done quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/). But if, Reader dearest, you desire something more than that: you've come to the right place. Today we're going to get our hands dirty with Python and the Twitter API, and code our own Twitter bot from scratch. Later, we'll even go over deploying the bot to Heroku and letting it loose to act autonomously in the cloud. If this piques your curiosity, then I'd love to show you how simple it can really be, with a pinch of Python magic.
