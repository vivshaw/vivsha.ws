# TODO

- [ ] code blocks
  - [ ] There's an error with `'` and `"` in Prism code blocks of unknown language, they turn into &quot;&quot;
  - [ ] Make `code` blocks more legible
  - [ ] Line numbers in code blocks - the line number plugin for remark-mdx seems somewhat borked, won't let me select a custom starting line
  - [ ] Code block highlights - the highlight plugin for remark-mdx applies correct tags but would require a deep restyle to look right
  - [ ] might make sense to swap to Shiki at this point? already doing dynamic routes
- [ ] MDX ergonomics
  - [ ] Nicer component for loading images in MDX?
  - [ ] Type post meta, if possible. or swap to using frontmatter! and at least document the metadata schema
- [ ] tooling
  - [ ] Monorepo it? (Turborepo? NX?)
  - [ ] Storybook & design system
  - [ ] image optimization for static exports?
  - [ ] Yarn PnP support? (Not compatible with Turborepo... yet!)
  - [ ] extract MDX components to a separate package?
- [ ] features
  - [ ] tags index page & tag pages, someday
  - [ ] Get "Next Post" working for real
  - [ ] contact page?
- [ ] UX
  - [ ] Fix janky width changing when scrollbar shows or hides, again. now it's on smaller screens?
  - [ ] more accessible focus states
  - [ ] new icon. dark mode icon would be sick whilst I'm at it.
- [ ] styling
  - [ ] find a more ergonomic solution for light/dark/system mode
  - [ ] stop using global transition variables, and standardize transitions more generally
  - [ ] sans is only used in tables, should I drop it?
  - [ ] better branded theme color
  - [ ] obliterate `pageStyles` directory
  - [ ] restyle so all pages can share `.centeringWrapper` etc. and Navbar can be pulled into the main layout
    - [ ] could then expand the use of grid from something that lives inside the blog post, to something used globally
    - [ ] that'd also let me make footer spacing really consistent, by defining it on the main wrapper
- [ ] make a better README
- [ ] get rid of ugly typecasts and disorganized logic in the metadata helpers
- [ ] stop using Adobe fonts so I can host locally and preload. go directly through Canada Type
