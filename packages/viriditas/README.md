# @vivshaw/viriditas

This package contains (the bones of) the design system used to style [vivsha.ws](https://vivsha.ws). It's built with [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), and uses no runtime stylesheets. The library itself does not use client React and is fully appropriate for React Server Components, although a Context is provided for cases where you _do_ want to access theme values dynamically at runtime.
